✅ Architect Verification
Status: 🟢 APPROVED - PRODUCTION-READY

Architect Findings:

✅ Firestore helper functions are defensive and safe
✅ Cloud Function rollback is complete (Auth + Firestore)
✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
✅ All production enhancements meet stated objectives
✅ NO REMAINING BLOCKERS
Critical Fixes Applied:

✅ Firestore rules now check userExists() before dereferencing
✅ Cloud Function tracks Auth user ID and deletes on rollback
✅ Firestore user doc created immediately after Auth user
